<h1 id="railsbridgebugmashserverscript">RailsBridge BugMash Server Script</h1>

<p><em>(I need a longer name. taking submissions.)</em></p>

<p>This is a script to take a debian box from ground zero to Rails Testing Machine. You will end up with MySQL, Postgres, Sqlite, Memcached and many rubies, as well as automated testing scripts.</p>

<h2 id="installationinstructions">Installation instructions</h2>

<p>1) untar the installer to your home directory (do do git clone git://github.com/tsykoduk/Rails-Bugmasher.git)
2) Setup password-less sudo for your work account (not mandatory, but nice)
3) There really needs to be a step three - don&#8217;t you think?
4) run the installer</p>

<h2 id="whatsitdoingunderthehood">What&#8217;s it doing under the hood?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s updating your system, grabbing a whole bunch of new packages, installing them, configuring them, getting rvm, installing 3 or 4 rubies and pressing on.</p>

<p><strong>Should I use this on my lovingly built workstation?</strong></p>

<p>Um, no?</p>

<p>Seriously, we are running automated updates, upgrades, and core system package installs. Use a VM that you just installed linux onto.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use this to build a production ready application server?</strong></p>

<p>Again - no.</p>

<p>Well, possibly - but we have done zero hardening, and several of the packages are for development, not front line, battle hardened servers. This is a development tool.</p>

<h2 id="legalstuff">Legal Stuff</h2>

<p>This is fully copylefted. If you find some use for it, please do let me know.</p>

<p>Portions developed by others - if there&#8217;s an error in the code, it&#8217;s totally my fault. If that error eats your code, face or data, it&#8217;s your fault.</p>
